# LinkedIn_Bot
**Overview**

The LinkedIn_Bot essentially provides a hand in allowing the user to take control of their interactions with their connections. With the LinkedIn_Connection_Bot.py file, you can send multiple connections requests along with a personalized note. The LinkedIn_Message_Bot.py allows you to send multiple messages to preexisting connections. As a result, the bot optimizes the time and energy put into communicating to a large group of people on LinkedIn.
