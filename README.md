# LinkedIn_Bot
**Overview** ðŸ‘¾ </br>
The LinkedIn_Bot essentially provides a hand in allowing the user to take control of their interactions with their connections. With the LinkedIn_Connection_Bot.py file, you can send multiple connections requests along with a personalized note. The LinkedIn_Message_Bot.py allows you to send multiple messages to preexisting connections. As a result, the bot optimizes the time and energy put into communicating to a large group of people on LinkedIn. 

**Technologies Implemented** ðŸ’» </br>
In the formulation of this program, I utilized **Python** as my choice of programming language to integrate **Selenium** to communicate with the web browser and for testing purposes. For my choice of the web browser, I selected Google Chrome which meant I needed to use the **ChromeDriver**. The WebDriver allowed me to obtain control and navigate through LinkedIn's web pages.
